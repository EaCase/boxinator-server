        You will need this to determine what is or is not displayed on your front end. Make use
        of best practices and use a Basic Authentication token in the HTTP Header.

        A failed authentication attempt should prompt a 401 Unauthorized response. This
        endpoint should also be subject to a rate limiting policy where if authentication is
        attempted too many times (unsuccessfully) then requests from the corresponding address
        should be temporarily ignored. Candidates should decide on an appropriate threshold
        for rate limiting.
